# physics-with-exercise

This repository is a personal project aimed at collecting and implementing **graduate-level physics exercises**—in **Python**—from various classical and modern physics topics. The exercises span from **Classical Mechanics** to **Quantum Mechanics**, including fields like Electrodynamics, Thermodynamics, Relativity, and more.

Each topic is organized into its own folder, and within each, specific exercises (usually inspired by or directly based on textbook problems) are implemented as Python modules or scripts.

> ⚠️ This is a personal, ongoing project. I don't know if I'll ever manage to reach the final goal—but I’ll try. It's my way of staying in touch with physics, even though I’m no longer working in the field.

## 📁 Repository Structure

## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/physics-exercise-collection.git
cd physics-exercise-collection

2. Create and activate a virtual environment

We strongly recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

python3.13 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run your first simulation

Each physics exercise folder contains a main.py or similar entry point. You can run individual modules or launch the optional GUI (when available).

📚 Sources

All exercises are adapted or inspired by well-known graduate-level physics textbooks. For example:

See each simulation's folder for detailed references.

🙋‍♂️ Why This Project?

After years working outside of academia and physics research, I found myself slowly forgetting the subject I loved and studied deeply. This project is a way to reconnect with physics—not through reading alone, but by solving and simulating the key problems that shaped the discipline.

I hope it can also help others who are looking for an interactive and structured way to revisit advanced physics concepts.
